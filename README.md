# Project Name: Star Wars API

Deployed API Link : https://raymond-api.herokuapp.com/

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create an API from scratch using JSON data. I based this project on my interest in  the historical movie franchise Star Wars. 

# Description:
This API was built from the ground up by using data from swapi.co. The API features three models which are Characters, Films and Starships. The Character model refers to all characters throughout the star wars films. The Films model refers to all the films that were created in the franchise. Lastly the Starships model refers to all of the intergalactic vehicles from the films. This API has full CRUD functionality allowing users to create, read, update and destroy/delete what they would like.

# Technologies Used: 
MongoDB, Heroku, Express.js, Node.js
 
## Installation Instructions for Use 
1. Fork and clone repository 
2. Inside the root directory run: 
- npm init -y

3. Code! 

# Roadmap:
